      <description>This post explains overheads of virtio, and introduce vhost that increases performance of virtio.
Virtio Review &amp;amp; Vhost Introduction # virtio-net example diagram. [Source] VirtI/O is implemented with virtqueues, shared by the guest and QEMU process. When the guest rings a doorbell after inserting requests into the virtqueue, the context is forwarded to host KVM handler (VM-exit), and again to QEMU process via ioeventfd. QEMU process reads the request from the shared virtqueue, and handles it.</description>

      <description>This post explains virtio and vhost, device virtualization techniques used in Linux kernel virtual machine (KVM). Here, I focus only on block device and network device virtualization.
Virtio (Virtual I/O) # Virtio is one of I/O (block, NIC, etc) virtualization techniques that are used in virtualization. It is a paravirtualized I/O solution that implements a set of communication framework for I/O interaction between guest applications and hypervisor 1 2, which means a device driver that is aware of virtualization is required.</description>
