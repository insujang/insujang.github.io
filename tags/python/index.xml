      <description>HF Transformers # HuggingFace (ðŸ¤—) Transformers is a library that enables to easily download the state-of-the-art pretrained models. It is also possible to create and train a model from scratch, after modifying the structure of existing models. Although the library starts from transformer based language models, it became a general community hub and includes other models such as convolution based Resnet.
It can easily be installed via pip 1:
pip install transformers  Most code is borrowed from HuggingFace transformers example codes.</description>
